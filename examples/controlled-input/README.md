# ControlledInput 

You type stuff into a text input and it shows you what you typed

## Instructions

These examples were built with [expo](https://expo.io/) and [spago](https://github.com/spacchetti/spago). 

 
* `npm install spago expo-cli --global`
* `spago install`
* `spago build`
* `npm install`
* `npm run start` or `npm run ios` or `npm run android` or `npm start web` (for web-based app preview)

## Code

The entry point for the app is in `App.js`. Note that the compiled PureScript code is imported, and then called in the `render` function.
